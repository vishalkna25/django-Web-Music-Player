# django-Web-Music-Player
In a web-based music player, anyone interested in listening to songs can play and download whatsoever song he/she wishes. The person can search for songs based on the name of the artist, the album in which the song was sung, or the name of the song itself. Web-Based Music Player would be managed by an administrator on the admin section. Thus there would be two different classes of users logging on to the site. One is the user looking for a song or songs, and then the administrator who controls the whole process.
